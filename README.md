# pycube-solver

This script defines a RubiksCube class that stores the state of a
3x3 cube and has methods to perform all of the common rotations.
The class also can read in an initial state from a file, and print
the state in the same manner to stdout.

It currently does not fully solve the cube, but only the first layer.

## TODO

1. ~~Separate class and solving logic into files~~
2. Finish logic to solve the cube completely
3. Document the data structures and algorithms used
